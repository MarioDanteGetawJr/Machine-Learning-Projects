# Unsupervised-Learning-ML---Movie-Analysis

- This is a project I completed in an Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Course at Oakton University.
The goal of this project was to demonstrate Unsupervised Learning techniques on a chart of movies for which we do not know the genre or release date.
Based on data about the movies, we use machine learning techniques in Python to make a guess.
- In the Python code, I created my criteria to make the predictions/guesses.
- The data on the movies is pulled from the 'ratings' text file.
