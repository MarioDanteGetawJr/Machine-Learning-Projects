# Interview Response Analyzer
Contents of this branch are the PDF file report and the Python code.
- The goals of this project were to include the following:
  - Simulate a personal interview with 10 custom questions.
  - Examine aspects of the responses to determine how equipped the candidate is for the job
    - Track how long users take to respond to each question.
    - Analyze response times to detect patterns, such as:
      - Hesitation
      - Uncertainty.
    - Familiarity with questions (e.g., faster second attempts)
    - Offer basic behavioral insights through timing data, not just answers.
    - Compare response behavior across different users.
