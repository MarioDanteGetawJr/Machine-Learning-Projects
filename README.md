# Interview Response Analyzer
The goals of this project were to include the following:
- Simulate a personal interview with 10 custom questions.
  - Track how long users take to respond to each question.
  - Analyze response times to detect patterns, such as:
  - Hesitation or uncertainty
  - Familiarity with questions (e.g., faster second attempts)
  - Offer basic behavioral insights through timing data, not just answers.
  - Compare response behavior across different users.
